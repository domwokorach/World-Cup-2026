## 🗂️ Module Responsibilities

| File | What it does | What it does NOT do |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| `data.js` | Stores all fixtures, converts UTC→BST, exports lookup maps | Touches the DOM |
| `teamGrid.js` | Builds & filters team cards | Knows about calendar or modes |
| `calendar.js` | Renders monthly calendar & day results | Knows about team cards |
| `bracket.js` | Renders knockout bracket | Knows about group stage |
| `export.js` | ICS file generation & download modal | Knows about rendering |
| `app.js` | Wires everything together, manages `currentMode` | Contains business logic |

## 🔄 Adding / Changing Data

To update fixtures (e.g. add confirmed knockout matchups):
1. Open `js/data.js`
2. Find the relevant entry in `FIXTURES_RAW` (e.g. the final placeholder)
3. Replace placeholder team names (`W101`, `W102`) with actual team names
4. Nothing else needs to change

To change a specific UI section (e.g. calendar):
- Edit only `js/calendar.js` — no other module is affected

To change styles:
- Edit only `css/styles.css`
